# High-Level Summary

This Jira issue set is based on the current Omni-Calc Rust execution model in the branch:

```text
BLOX-2104-improve-preload-snapshot-py-rust-pass
```

The branch has already moved metadata access toward Rust-side preload using `PreloadedMetadata`, which reduces Python callback dependency during execution. This creates a path toward real Rust-side parallel execution in the future.

However, the current executor still processes Python-provided `calc_steps` sequentially and mutates a shared `ExecutionContext` during node execution.

Current model:

```text
Python DAG manager creates ordered calc_steps
        ↓
Rust receives CalcPlan
        ↓
Rust creates one mutable ExecutionContext
        ↓
Rust loops through calc_steps in order
        ↓
Each node directly mutates shared state
        ↓
Resolver is updated during node processing
        ↓
Final RecordBatches are built
```

Target architecture:

```text
Current serial executor
    ↓
Immutable execution snapshots
    ↓
Per-node NodeOutput
    ↓
Central merge phase
    ↓
Explicit Rust-side execution graph
    ↓
Single-threaded Kahn scheduler
    ↓
Safe foundation for future parallelism
    ↓
Parallel ready-node execution in later follow-up issues
```

## Summary

Refactor the Rust `omni-calc` executor so it is structurally ready for a future Kahn-style parallel DAG scheduler.

The current Rust executor processes Python-provided `calc_steps` sequentially and mutates a shared `ExecutionContext` during node execution. This is safe for the current serial model, but it prevents safe, deterministic, and meaningful parallel execution of independent ready nodes.

This issue should create the architecture required for future parallelism, but it should **not** implement actual Rayon/thread-pool parallel execution yet.

The goal is to move from:

```text
calc_steps[0] -> calc_steps[1] -> calc_steps[2] -> ...
```

to a single-threaded version of:

```text
ready queue
    ↓
execute ready node
    ↓
return NodeOutput
    ↓
merge output centrally
    ↓
update resolver at safe boundary
    ↓
release dependent nodes
```

This gives the executor a correct dependency-driven foundation before any parallel worker execution is introduced.

---

## Background / Context

The current execution flow is mainly in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/executor.rs
```

Current simplified flow:

```rust
pub fn execute(_engine: &mut Engine, plan: Plan) -> Result<CalcResult> {
    let start = Instant::now();

    let mut ctx = ExecutionContext::new(&plan, _engine.preloaded_metadata());

    preload_connected_dimensions(&mut ctx);

    for step in &plan.request.calc_steps {
        match step.calc_type.as_str() {
            "input" => process_input_step(&mut ctx, step),
            "calculation" => process_calculation_step(&mut ctx, step),
            "sequential" => process_sequential_step(&mut ctx, step),
            _ => {}
        }
    }

    build_execution_result(&ctx, start)
}
```

Important point:

```rust
process_input_step(&mut ctx, step)
process_calculation_step(&mut ctx, step)
process_sequential_step(&mut ctx, step)
```

Each step receives mutable access to the same `ExecutionContext`.

The executor comments also state that the `calc_steps` are already ordered by the Python DAG manager, so Rust simply processes them in order.

Today Rust is effectively doing:

```text
Python-built topological step order
        ↓
Rust sequentially executes each step
        ↓
Each node mutates shared executor state
```

Rust is **not yet** doing:

```text
Build Rust-side graph
        ↓
Track indegrees
        ↓
Find dependency-free ready nodes
        ↓
Execute ready nodes
        ↓
Merge outputs
        ↓
Release dependents
```

---

## Current Graph Representation

The graph-like request data comes from:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/integration/calc_plan.rs
```

Relevant structures:

```rust
pub struct CalcPlan {
    pub scenario_id: i64,
    pub forecast_start_date: Option<String>,
    pub model_start_date: Option<String>,
    pub time_granularity: String,
    pub fy_start_month: String,
    pub blocks: HashMap<String, BlockSpec>,
    pub dimensions: HashMap<String, DimensionSpec>,
    pub calc_steps: Vec<CalcStep>,
    pub metadata: CalcMetadata,
    pub node_maps: Vec<PlannedNodeMap>,
    pub variable_filters: HashMap<String, VariableFilter>,
    pub property_specs: HashMap<String, PropertySpec>,
}
```

Current step structure:

```rust
pub struct CalcStep {
    pub calc_type: String,
    pub nodes: Vec<String>,
}
```

Rust receives ordered steps like:

```json
[
  { "calc_type": "input", "nodes": ["ind1", "ind2"] },
  { "calc_type": "calculation", "nodes": ["ind3"] },
  { "calc_type": "sequential", "nodes": ["ind4", "ind5"] }
]
```

But Rust does not currently maintain:

```rust
struct ExecutionGraph {
    nodes: HashMap<NodeId, ExecNode>,
    indegree: HashMap<NodeId, usize>,
    outgoing: HashMap<NodeId, Vec<NodeId>>,
}
```

Dependency ordering is mostly implicit in `calc_steps`.

Cross-object mapping is represented separately using:

```rust
PlannedNodeMap
VariableFilter
PropertySpec
```

---

## Current Shared Mutable State

The shared state is defined in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/context.rs
```

Current `ExecutionContext` concept:

```rust
pub struct ExecutionContext<'a> {
    pub calc_object_states: HashMap<String, CalcObjectState>,
    pub resolver: CrossObjectResolver,
    pub plan: &'a Plan,
    pub preloaded_metadata: Option<&'a PreloadedMetadata>,
    pub string_property_map_cache: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), StringPropertyMap>,
    pub numeric_property_map_cache: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), (PropertyMap, Vec<String>)>,
    pub input_handler: InputStepHandler,
    pub calc_handler: CalculationStepHandler,
    pub seq_handler: SequentialStepHandler,
    pub nodes_calculated: usize,
    pub warnings: Vec<CalcWarning>,
}
```

The following shared mutable fields are important for parallelism:

```text
ctx.calc_object_states
ctx.resolver
ctx.warnings
ctx.nodes_calculated
ctx.string_property_map_cache
ctx.numeric_property_map_cache
```

Today this is fine because execution is serial.

In a parallel-ready design, node execution should not directly mutate these shared fields.

---

## Current State Mutation During Calculation

Current calculation processing lives in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/executor.rs
```

`process_calculation_step` loops node-by-node:

```rust
for node_id in &step.nodes {
    ...
}
```

Inside each node, the code may:

```rust
ctx.warnings.push(warning);
```

```rust
state.number_columns.push((col_name, values));
```

```rust
state.string_columns.push((col_name, values));
```

```rust
state.connected_dim_columns.push((col_name, values));
```

```rust
ctx.nodes_calculated += step_res.count;
```

```rust
ctx.update_resolver(&block_key);
```

So each node currently does:

```text
dependency resolution
+ property collection
+ cross-object resolution
+ formula evaluation
+ state mutation
+ warning collection
+ resolver update
```

This mixing of calculation and mutation is the main blocker for safe parallelism.

---

## Why `Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>>` Is Not Acceptable

A naive approach would be:

```rust
let ctx = Arc::new(Mutex::new(ctx));

ready_nodes.into_par_iter().for_each(|node| {
    let mut ctx = ctx.lock().unwrap();
    process_node(&mut ctx, node);
});
```

This is not a good production design.

Reason:

```text
The whole executor state is locked for the entire node execution.
Only one worker can actually run node logic at a time.
Expensive formula evaluation happens while holding the lock.
Resolver updates happen while holding the lock.
State mutation happens while holding the lock.
This provides thread safety but not true parallel speedup.
```

Rejected production design:

```rust
Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>>
```

around the full node lifecycle.

Preferred design:

```text
Build immutable snapshot
        ↓
Execute node without global mutation
        ↓
Return NodeOutput
        ↓
Merge output in one short controlled mutation phase
```

---

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Keep `ExecutionContext` Coordinator-Owned

`ExecutionContext` should remain the owner of mutable execution state, but only the coordinator/scheduler should mutate it.

Workers or node execution functions should not take:

```rust
&mut ExecutionContext
```

for full node processing.

Target:

```text
ExecutionContext = coordinator-owned mutable state
```

---

### 2. Add Immutable `ExecutionSnapshot`

Add a read-only snapshot containing all data required for a node to calculate safely.

Example concept:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct ExecutionSnapshot {
    block_key: String,
    block_spec: Arc<BlockSpec>,

    dim_columns: Arc<Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>>,
    number_columns: Arc<Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>>,
    string_columns: Arc<Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>>,
    connected_dim_columns: Arc<Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>>,

    resolver_snapshot: Arc<CrossObjectResolverSnapshot>,
    preloaded_metadata: Arc<PreloadedMetadata>,
    property_cache_snapshot: Arc<PropertyCacheSnapshot>,
}
```

Purpose:

```text
ExecutionSnapshot = read-only node input
```

A node should be executable using only:

```rust
fn execute_node(snapshot: ExecutionSnapshot, node: ExecNode) -> NodeOutput
```

No global mutable context should be required during calculation.

---

### 3. Add `NodeOutput`

Instead of directly pushing results into `CalcObjectState`, node execution should return an output object.

Example:

```rust
struct NodeOutput {
    block_key: String,

    number_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>,
    string_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,
    connected_dim_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,

    warnings: Vec<CalcWarning>,
    nodes_calculated: usize,

    should_update_resolver: bool,
}
```

This makes the node execution output explicit.

Worker-like flow:

```rust
let output = execute_node(snapshot, node);
```

Coordinator flow:

```rust
merge_node_output(&mut ctx, output);
```

---

### 4. Add Centralized Merge Phase

Only the merge phase should mutate `ExecutionContext`.

Example:

```rust
fn merge_node_output(ctx: &mut ExecutionContext, output: NodeOutput) {
    if let Some(state) = ctx.calc_object_states.get_mut(&output.block_key) {
        for col in output.number_columns {
            if !state.number_columns.iter().any(|(name, _)| name == &col.0) {
                state.number_columns.push(col);
            }
        }

        for col in output.string_columns {
            if !state.string_columns.iter().any(|(name, _)| name == &col.0) {
                state.string_columns.push(col);
            }
        }

        for col in output.connected_dim_columns {
            if !state.connected_dim_columns.iter().any(|(name, _)| name == &col.0) {
                state.connected_dim_columns.push(col);
            }
        }
    }

    ctx.warnings.extend(output.warnings);
    ctx.nodes_calculated += output.nodes_calculated;

    if output.should_update_resolver {
        ctx.update_resolver(&output.block_key);
    }
}
```

This creates a controlled mutation point.

Important rule:

```text
Do not lock/mutate during calculation.
Only mutate during merge.
```

---

## Rust-Side Execution Graph

### Proposed Types

Add:

```rust
struct ExecutionGraph {
    nodes: HashMap<String, ExecNode>,
    outgoing: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
    indegree: HashMap<String, usize>,
}
```

Add:

```rust
struct ExecNode {
    id: String,
    block_key: String,
    calc_type: ExecNodeType,
    deps: Vec<String>,
    outputs: Vec<String>,
    parallel_safe: bool,
}
```

Add:

```rust
enum ExecNodeType {
    InputIndicator,
    Property,
    Calculation,
    SequentialGroup,
}
```

---

## Graph Construction Inputs

Build the graph from:

```text
CalcPlan.calc_steps
CalcPlan.blocks
BlockSpec.indicators
IndicatorSpec.parsed_formula
CalcPlan.property_specs
CalcPlan.node_maps
CalcPlan.variable_filters
```

---

## Dependency Tracking Requirements

### 1. Intra-Block Indicator Dependencies

If formula for `ind200` references `ind100`, graph should contain:

```text
ind100 -> ind200
```

Meaning:

```text
ind200 cannot execute until ind100 is merged.
```

---

### 2. Cross-Object Dependencies

Relevant resolver file:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/resolver.rs
```

`CrossObjectResolver` stores calculated source block data:

```rust
pub struct CrossObjectResolver {
    calculated_blocks: HashMap<String, BlockData>,
    node_maps: HashMap<NodeMapKey, PlannedNodeMap>,
    variable_filters: HashMap<String, VariableFilter>,
}
```

Current resolver expects source block to already exist:

```rust
let source_block = self.calculated_blocks.get(&source_block_key)
    .ok_or_else(|| Error::eval_error(...))?;
```

A formula reference like:

```text
block39951___ind259068
```

means the target node must wait until:

```text
source block b39951 has ind259068 calculated
source block is materialized into resolver
resolver has needed connected dimension columns for joins/filters
```

In graph form:

```text
b39951.ind259068 -> target_node
```

---

### 3. Planned NodeMap Dependencies

`PlannedNodeMap` includes:

```rust
source_block_key
target_block_key
variable_name
source_dims_that_map
additional_columns_for_join
merge_on
groupby
property_join_columns
aggregation_mode
```

The graph should preserve dependencies implied by:

```text
source_block_key
target_block_key
variable_name
property_join_columns
additional_columns_for_join
```

If property bridge columns are required for a cross-object join, the source block snapshot must include them before the dependent node runs.

---

### 4. Variable Filter Dependencies

`VariableFilter` includes:

```rust
variable_name
source_block_key
source_node_id
filters
```

Filtered cross-object references should be treated as dependencies on:

```text
source block
source node
filter dimension/property availability
connected dimension columns if linked_dimension_id is used
```

---

### 5. Property Dependencies

Relevant files:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/preload.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/dim_loader.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/input_handler/mod.rs
```

This branch adds `PreloadedMetadata`:

```rust
pub struct PreloadedMetadata {
    pub dimension_items: HashMap<i64, Vec<DimensionItem>>,
    pub property_maps: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), HashMap<i64, String>>,
}
```

Property loading has Rust snapshot-based functions:

```rust
load_string_property_map_from_snapshot(...)
load_property_map_from_snapshot(...)
```

But legacy PyO3 callback functions still exist:

```rust
load_property_map(py, metadata_cache, ...)
load_string_property_map(py, metadata_cache, ...)
```

Graph/scheduler work must ensure future worker execution paths use preloaded Rust data only.

---

### 6. Sequential Group Dependencies

Sequential steps must be atomic.

Current sequential handler:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/sequential.rs
```

Sequential formulas include:

```text
rollfwd(...)
prior(...)
balance(...)
change(...)
lookup(...)
```

These use period-by-period evaluation with entity state/history.

Do not split a sequential step like:

```text
nodes = [ind1, ind2, ind3]
```

into independent graph nodes.

Represent it as:

```rust
ExecNode {
    id: "seq_group_<id>",
    block_key,
    calc_type: ExecNodeType::SequentialGroup,
    deps,
    outputs: vec!["ind1", "ind2", "ind3"],
    parallel_safe: false,
}
```

---

## Single-Threaded Kahn Scheduler

Before adding Rayon or worker threads, add a single-threaded Kahn scheduler.

Pseudo-code:

```rust
let mut ready = VecDeque::new();

for node in graph.nodes.values() {
    if graph.indegree[&node.id] == 0 {
        ready.push_back(node.id.clone());
    }
}

while let Some(node_id) = ready.pop_front() {
    let node = graph.nodes[&node_id].clone();

    let snapshot = build_snapshot(&ctx, &node);
    let output = execute_node(snapshot, node);

    merge_node_output(&mut ctx, output);

    update_resolver_if_needed(&mut ctx, &node);

    for dep in graph.outgoing[&node_id].iter() {
        graph.indegree[dep] -= 1;
        if graph.indegree[dep] == 0 {
            ready.push_back(dep.clone());
        }
    }
}
```

The first implementation must remain single-threaded.

Purpose:

```text
Validate graph correctness.
Validate dependency ordering.
Validate resolver materialization timing.
Validate output parity with current calc_steps execution.
Keep sequential groups atomic.
```

---

## Resolver Materialization / Snapshot Strategy

Current resolver update:

```rust
pub fn update_resolver(&mut self, block_key: &str) {
    if let Some(state) = self.calc_object_states.get(block_key) {
        if let Ok(batch) = build_record_batch(state) {
            self.resolver.add_block(block_key.to_string(), batch);
        }
    }
}
```

Current issue:

```text
Node 1 -> rebuild full RecordBatch
Node 2 -> rebuild full RecordBatch
Node 3 -> rebuild full RecordBatch
```

`build_record_batch` clones:

```rust
StringArray::from(values.clone())
Float64Array::from(values.clone())
```

This is expensive and makes resolver mutation tightly coupled to node execution.

### Proposed Direction

Node execution should not call:

```rust
ctx.update_resolver(...)
```

directly.

Instead:

```text
execute node
return NodeOutput
merge output
update resolver at dependency-safe boundary
release dependents
```

### Read-Only Resolver Snapshot Concept

Add a read-only snapshot concept:

```rust
struct CrossObjectResolverSnapshot {
    calculated_blocks: Arc<HashMap<String, BlockData>>,
    node_maps: Arc<HashMap<NodeMapKey, PlannedNodeMap>>,
    variable_filters: Arc<HashMap<String, VariableFilter>>,
}
```

Future workers should read from resolver snapshots.

Workers should not mutate:

```rust
ctx.resolver
```

---

## Python Callback Boundary / Preload Requirement

Python boundary:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/python.rs
```

The branch preloads metadata before Rust execution:

```rust
let preloaded =
    crate::engine::exec::preload::preload_metadata(py, metadata_cache.as_ref(), &plan.inner)
        .map_err(pyo3::exceptions::PyRuntimeError::new_err)?;

engine.set_preloaded_metadata(preloaded);

let result = py
    .allow_threads(|| runtime::execute(&mut engine, plan.inner.clone()))
    .map_err(|e| pyo3::exceptions::PyRuntimeError::new_err(e.to_string()))?;
```

This is good because Rust execution happens inside:

```rust
py.allow_threads(...)
```

Meaning:

```text
Rust execution can run without holding the Python GIL.
```

However, worker-ready execution must not call Python at all.

### Required Mode

Add a conceptual mode:

```rust
enum MetadataAccessMode {
    PreloadedOnly,
    PythonFallbackAllowed,
}
```

Future parallel/worker-ready execution should require:

```rust
MetadataAccessMode::PreloadedOnly
```

If required metadata is missing, fail early with a clear error.

Do not lazy-load metadata from Python inside node execution.

---

## Scope

This issue includes:

```text
1. Introduce ExecutionSnapshot or equivalent read-only node input.
2. Introduce NodeOutput or equivalent per-node result.
3. Centralize state mutation in merge_node_output or equivalent.
4. Build explicit Rust-side ExecutionGraph.
5. Track node dependencies, outgoing edges, and indegrees.
6. Represent sequential steps as atomic non-parallel-safe nodes.
7. Implement single-threaded Kahn scheduler behind a feature flag/config.
8. Keep existing serial calc_steps execution path as default until parity is proven.
9. Refactor resolver updates to be coordinator-owned.
10. Add/read-only resolver snapshot concept for future worker execution.
11. Ensure worker-style execution paths use PreloadedMetadata only.
12. Reject global Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>> around full node execution.
13. Reject parallelizing sequential groups in this foundation issue.
```

---

## Out of Scope

This issue should not implement real parallel execution yet.

Out of scope:

```text
Full parallel scheduler with worker threads
Rayon/thread-pool integration
Work-stealing optimization
Parallelizing independent input indicators
Parallelizing property map population/property nodes
Parallelizing independent calculation nodes
Parallelizing final RecordBatch materialization
Parallelizing connected dimension preload
Parallelizing join-path creation/alignment
Parallel aggregation for lookup maps
Parallelizing sequential groups
Changing calculation semantics
Changing Python DAG manager behavior
Changing output format
```

---

## Proposed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Snapshot + Output Model

Add:

```rust
ExecutionSnapshot
NodeOutput
merge_node_output(...)
```

Refactor internals so node execution can eventually return `NodeOutput`.

Initial implementation can still run serially.

---

### Phase 2: Centralize Mutation

Move these operations into merge/coordinator functions:

```rust
ctx.warnings.push(...)
ctx.nodes_calculated += ...
state.number_columns.push(...)
state.string_columns.push(...)
state.connected_dim_columns.push(...)
ctx.update_resolver(...)
```

---

### Phase 3: Add ExecutionGraph

Add:

```rust
ExecutionGraph
ExecNode
ExecNodeType
```

Graph should include:

```text
node id
block key
node type
dependencies
outputs
parallel_safe
outgoing dependents
indegree
```

---

### Phase 4: Graph Diagnostics

Add diagnostics:

```text
print/debug node dependencies
print/debug ready nodes
detect cycles
compare graph topological order with current calc_steps order
```

---

### Phase 5: Single-Threaded Kahn Execution

Add:

```rust
execute_with_kahn_scheduler(ctx, graph)
```

behind a feature flag/config.

Keep existing execution path until parity is proven.

---

### Phase 6: Resolver Boundary Cleanup

Make resolver updates coordinator-owned.

Workers or node execution functions should not directly mutate resolver.

---

### Phase 7: Preloaded-Only Validation

Audit execution paths to ensure future worker-ready paths do not use:

```rust
Python<'_>
PyObject
metadata_cache.call_method1(...)
metadata_cache.getattr(...)
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Architecture

- `ExecutionSnapshot` or equivalent exists.
- `NodeOutput` or equivalent exists.
- Node execution can be separated from global state mutation.
- Shared state mutation is centralized.
- Full `ExecutionContext` is not locked for entire node execution.
- Existing serial path remains available.

### Graph

- Rust can build an explicit graph from `CalcPlan`.
- Graph includes input nodes, property nodes, calculation nodes, and sequential groups.
- Graph tracks dependencies, outgoing edges, and indegrees.
- Sequential groups are represented as atomic nodes.
- Cross-object references become explicit dependencies.
- Property dependencies are represented or validated.
- Cycle detection exists.

### Scheduler

- Single-threaded Kahn scheduler exists behind config/feature flag.
- Kahn scheduler produces same outputs as current serial calc_steps execution.
- Resolver updates happen at safe boundaries.
- Dependent nodes are released only after required outputs are merged.

### Resolver

- Resolver mutation is coordinator-owned.
- Node execution does not directly call resolver updates.
- Read-only resolver snapshot concept exists.
- Cross-object references still resolve correctly.

### Python / Preload

- Future worker-style execution path uses `PreloadedMetadata`.
- Missing preloaded metadata fails early with a clear diagnostic.
- Python callback loaders are not used in worker-ready paths.
- No PyO3/Python callbacks should occur inside the Rust Omni-Calc execution hot path after preload. PyO3 should remain only at the Python boundary/preload stage.

### Rejected Designs

- No production implementation uses one global `Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>>` around full node execution.
- Sequential groups are not parallelized.

---

## Testing Notes

Add or update tests for:

### Snapshot / Output / Merge

```text
numeric column merge
string column merge
connected dimension column merge
duplicate column prevention
warning merge behavior
node count merge behavior
resolver update trigger behavior
```

### Graph Construction

```text
input -> calculation dependency
multiple independent inputs
intra-block formula dependency
cross-block blockX___indY dependency
property dependency
filtered cross-object dependency
sequential group as atomic node
cycle detection
topological order parity with calc_steps
```

### Kahn Scheduler

```text
pure input plan
simple calculated indicator
calculated indicator depending on another indicator
cross-block reference
property join
filtered reference
sequential step
actuals / forecast-start behavior
serial executor vs Kahn executor parity
```

### Resolver

```text
source block available before dependent node
source indicator exists in resolver batch
connected dimension columns included in resolver batch
resolver update after merge
missing source block diagnostic
missing indicator column diagnostic
```

### Python / Preload

```text
complete preload success
missing dimension items
missing property map
preloaded-only mode rejects missing metadata
no Python callback required during worker-ready execution
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
Hidden dependencies may exist that are currently only protected by Python calc_steps ordering.
Cross-object references require resolver snapshots at precise times.
Connected dimension columns may be needed in resolver batches for property-bridge joins.
Warning order may change if graph order differs from calc_steps.
Column order may matter for downstream consumers.
Duplicate columns must be handled deterministically.
Sequential groups must remain atomic.
Preloaded metadata may not cover every legacy path.
Removing lazy Python fallback may expose missing metadata gaps.
Single-threaded Kahn must prove parity before any Rayon parallelism is attempted.

# ISSUE 2

## Issue Type

Epic / Story

---

## Title

Add Configurable Rayon-Based Parallel Execution for Independent Ready Nodes

---

## Original Tickets Merged Into This Issue

```text
Ticket 4  - Parallelize independent input indicators
Ticket 5  - Parallelize property map population/property nodes
Ticket 6  - Parallelize independent calculation nodes
Ticket 13 - Configurable Rayon/thread-pool strategy
```

---

## Summary

After Issue 1 lands and the executor has a safe graph/snapshot/output/merge architecture, add actual parallel execution for independent ready nodes.

This issue should use the Rust-side Kahn scheduler to find dependency-free ready nodes and execute safe nodes concurrently using Rayon.

Parallelize only nodes that are proven independent and safe:

```text
input indicator nodes
property nodes using preloaded metadata
calculation nodes with complete dependencies
```

Do not parallelize sequential groups.

---

## Background / Context

The branch already includes:

```text
rayon = "1.10"
```

in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/Cargo.toml
```

However, current Rust execution does not yet use Rayon for executor scheduling.

The branch also moves metadata toward Rust-side preload, which allows property-related execution to avoid Python callbacks when `PreloadedMetadata` is complete.

---

## Problem Statement

Even after Issue 1, execution will still be single-threaded.

The next opportunity is to run independent ready nodes concurrently.

Examples:

```text
multiple input indicators in the same ready layer
multiple property nodes that only read preloaded metadata
multiple calculation nodes whose dependencies are already merged
```

Current executor processes these sequentially.

---

## Scope

This issue includes:

```text
1. Add configurable Rayon/thread-pool strategy.
2. Parallelize independent input indicator nodes.
3. Parallelize property map population/property node execution where metadata is preloaded.
4. Parallelize independent calculation nodes.
5. Preserve deterministic merge order.
6. Keep sequential groups excluded.
7. Keep serial fallback mode.
```

---

## Technical Analysis

### Input Nodes

Input loading is handled in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/input_handler/mod.rs
```

Input processing includes:

```text
parse data_values_json
detect input type
build DimensionMapper
build TimeUtils
load constant/raw/growth/constant_by_year values
apply actuals / forecast-start behavior
```

This is mostly local CPU work and does not require Python callbacks.

Parallelism level:

```text
independent calc execution
dependency graph layer execution
```

---

### Property Nodes

Property data is now available through:

```text
PreloadedMetadata
```

Snapshot-based functions:

```rust
load_string_property_map_from_snapshot(...)
load_property_map_from_snapshot(...)
```

Property maps should be prebuilt or read-only during node execution.

Parallelism level:

```text
cache population
preloaded metadata processing
independent property node execution
```

---

### Calculation Nodes

Formula evaluation is Rust-local via:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/calculation.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/formula_eval.rs
```

A calculation node can run in parallel if:

```text
all dependencies are already merged
required cross-object columns are available in the snapshot
required property columns are available from immutable property cache
it writes unique output columns
it is not a sequential group
it does not depend on another node in the same batch
```

Parallelism level:

```text
independent calc execution
dependency graph layer execution
batch formula evaluation
```

---

## Proposed Change

### Add Config

Add or extend engine config:

```rust
pub struct EngineConfig {
    pub enable_parallel_execution: bool,
    pub parallel_threads: Option<usize>,
    pub parallel_node_threshold: usize,
    pub parallel_row_threshold: usize,
}
```

### Add Parallel Execution Path

Conceptual flow:

```rust
while !ready.is_empty() {
    let parallel_batch = collect_parallel_safe_ready_nodes(&ready);

    let outputs: Vec<NodeOutput> = parallel_batch
        .into_par_iter()
        .map(|node| {
            let snapshot = build_snapshot_readonly(&ctx, &node);
            execute_node(snapshot, node)
        })
        .collect();

    for output in stable_merge_order(outputs) {
        merge_node_output(&mut ctx, output);
    }

    update_ready_queue();
}
```

### Deterministic Merge

Even if execution is parallel, merge must be deterministic.

Recommended:

```text
sort outputs by graph order / node order / original calc_steps order before merge
```

---

## Why Rayon Is Appropriate

Rayon is appropriate because this is CPU-bound Rust work:

```text
formula evaluation
input value generation
property map processing
vector calculations
```

Async is not appropriate for these execution paths because there is no IO wait inside worker node execution after preload.

Work-stealing should not be customized initially. Rayon’s default scheduler is sufficient for first implementation.

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
Oversubscription if Python service handles many requests concurrently.
Nested Rayon usage could cause excessive parallelism.
Parallel output order must be deterministic.
Warnings must be stable or explicitly ordered.
Memory usage may increase when many large nodes run concurrently.
Hidden dependencies must be caught by graph construction.
Property cache must be immutable/read-only during worker execution.
Workers must not mutate ExecutionContext.
Workers must not mutate resolver.
Workers must not call Python.
```

---

## Dependencies

Requires Issue 1.

Specifically requires:

```text
ExecutionSnapshot
NodeOutput
central merge phase
ExecutionGraph
single-threaded Kahn scheduler parity
preloaded-only worker path
resolver snapshot safety
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Parallel execution can be enabled/disabled by config.
- Serial fallback remains available.
- Rayon worker count can be configured or controlled.
- Independent input nodes can execute in parallel.
- Property nodes can execute in parallel using preloaded metadata only.
- Independent calculation nodes can execute in parallel.
- Workers do not mutate `ExecutionContext`.
- Workers do not mutate `CrossObjectResolver`.
- Workers do not call Python.
- Merge order is deterministic.
- Output matches serial Kahn execution.
- Sequential groups are excluded.

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
serial vs parallel parity
different Rayon thread counts
parallel independent input indicators
parallel property nodes
parallel independent calculation nodes
dependent nodes not running too early
cross-block dependency ordering
deterministic warnings
deterministic output schema/order
parallel disabled fallback
missing preload rejected in parallel mode
```

# ISSUE 3

## Issue Type

Performance Task

---

## Title

Parallelize Final RecordBatch Materialization Across Blocks

---

## Original Ticket

```text
Ticket 8 - Parallelize final RecordBatch materialization
```

---

## Summary

Parallelize final output `RecordBatch` construction across blocks after execution completes.

This is an independent performance optimization because final result materialization is naturally per-block and happens after executor mutation is complete.

---

## Background / Context

Final result building is in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/context.rs
```

Current result building loops through `ctx.calc_object_states` and calls:

```rust
build_record_batch(state)
```

for each block.

`build_record_batch` clones columns into Arrow arrays:

```rust
StringArray::from(values.clone())
Float64Array::from(values.clone())
```

---

## Problem Statement

Final block materialization is sequential.

For models with many blocks or large block states, this can be CPU/memory-copy heavy.

Since final execution state should be read-only at this point, each block’s `RecordBatch` can be built independently.

---

## Proposed Change

Use Rayon to build batches per block:

```rust
let batches: Vec<(String, RecordBatch)> = ctx.calc_object_states
    .par_iter()
    .filter(|(block_key, _)| block_key.starts_with('b'))
    .filter_map(|(block_key, state)| {
        build_record_batch(state)
            .ok()
            .map(|batch| (block_key.clone(), batch))
    })
    .collect();
```

Then sort and insert deterministically:

```rust
let mut batches = batches;
batches.sort_by(|a, b| a.0.cmp(&b.0));

for (block_key, batch) in batches {
    result.add_block(block_key, batch);
}
```

---

## Parallelism Opportunity

```text
snapshot/materialization work
per-block final output build
```

---

## Expected Impact

```text
Faster final result build for many-block models.
Low risk because state is read-only after execution.
No dependency graph changes required.
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
Higher memory pressure because multiple Arrow arrays may be built at once.
Block output ordering must remain deterministic.
Errors must be handled consistently with current serial behavior.
```

---

## Dependencies

Can be done independently.

Recommended after Issue 1 for cleaner state ownership.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Final `RecordBatch` creation can run in parallel per block.
- Output matches serial implementation.
- Block ordering is deterministic.
- Errors are handled consistently.
- Serial fallback exists or can be configured.
- Tests cover multiple block outputs and schema parity.

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
multiple block outputs
numeric columns
string columns
connected dimension columns
duplicate column warning behavior
serial vs parallel result parity
large synthetic block materialization benchmark
```

# ISSUE 4

## Issue Type

Performance Task / Tech Debt

---

## Title

Parallelize Connected Dimension Preload Across Blocks

---

## Original Ticket

```text
Ticket 9 - Parallelize connected dimension preload
```

---

## Summary

Refactor `preload_connected_dimensions` so connected dimension columns are computed per block in parallel and merged afterward.

---

## Background / Context

Connected dimension preload is currently in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/executor.rs
```

Function:

```rust
fn preload_connected_dimensions(ctx: &mut ExecutionContext)
```

Current behavior:

```text
for each block
    for each block dimension
        inspect DimensionSpec.property_values
        build connected dimension columns
        mutate state.connected_dim_columns
```

This is currently sequential and mixes computation with state mutation.

---

## Problem Statement

Connected dimension preload is mostly independent per block.

However, current implementation directly reads and mutates `ExecutionContext`.

This prevents safe parallel execution and makes the logic harder to reason about.

---

## Proposed Change

Split into compute and merge phases.

Compute phase:

```rust
fn compute_connected_dims_for_block(
    snapshot: ConnectedDimPreloadSnapshot,
    block_key: String,
) -> BlockConnectedDimOutput
```

Output:

```rust
struct BlockConnectedDimOutput {
    block_key: String,
    connected_dim_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,
    warnings: Vec<CalcWarning>,
}
```

Parallel compute:

```rust
let outputs: Vec<BlockConnectedDimOutput> = block_keys
    .par_iter()
    .map(|block_key| compute_connected_dims_for_block(snapshot.clone(), block_key.clone()))
    .collect();
```

Deterministic merge:

```rust
for output in stable_order(outputs) {
    merge_connected_dim_output(&mut ctx, output);
}
```

---

## Parallelism Opportunity

```text
preload work
per-block preprocessing
cache population
```

---

## Expected Impact

```text
Faster preload for models with many blocks/dimensions.
Cleaner compute/merge separation.
Less shared mutable state during preload.
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
Duplicate connected dimension columns must still be skipped.
Merge order must be deterministic.
Existing warning/logging behavior may change.
Parallel logging may become noisy.
Must avoid reading mutable state while merging.
```

---

## Dependencies

Can be done independently.

Recommended after Issue 1 or with a local compute/merge split.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Connected dimension computation does not mutate `ExecutionContext`.
- Per-block connected dimension computation can run in parallel.
- Merge preserves current output behavior.
- Duplicate column handling remains correct.
- Serial and parallel preload outputs match.
- Logging remains usable.

---

## Testing Notes

```text
block with no connected dimensions
block with connected dimension property values
multiple blocks with connected dimensions
duplicate connected dimension columns
missing dimension specs

# ISSUE 5

## Issue Type

Performance Task

---

## Title

Parallelize Join-Path Creation and Target Alignment for Large Cross-Object Joins

---

## Original Ticket

```text
Ticket 10 - Parallelize join-path creation/alignment
```

---

## Summary

Add threshold-based parallel implementations for join-path creation and target alignment in node alignment code.

---

## Background / Context

Cross-object alignment uses:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/node_alignment/join_path.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/node_alignment/lookup.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/node_alignment/mod.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/resolver.rs
```

Current join path build:

```rust
pub fn build_all_join_paths(
    dim_columns: &[(String, Vec<String>)],
    dim_names: &[String],
) -> Vec<String> {
    (0..row_count)
        .map(|row_idx| build_join_path(dim_columns, dim_names, row_idx))
        .collect()
}
```

Current target alignment:

```rust
for path in target_join_paths {
    let value = lookup.get(path).copied().unwrap_or(default_value);
    result.push(value);
}
```

---

## Problem Statement

For large row counts, join path construction and target alignment can be CPU/memory intensive.

These operations are currently sequential.

---

## Proposed Change

Add parallel variants:

```rust
pub fn build_all_join_paths_parallel(...)
pub fn align_with_lookup_parallel(...)
```

Use threshold-based fallback:

```text
if row_count < threshold:
    use serial implementation
else:
    use parallel implementation
```

Example:

```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

(0..row_count)
    .into_par_iter()
    .map(|row_idx| build_join_path(dim_columns, dim_names, row_idx))
    .collect()
```

For alignment:

```rust
target_join_paths
    .par_iter()
    .map(|path| lookup.get(path).copied().unwrap_or(default_value))
    .collect()
```

---

## Parallelism Opportunity

```text
cross-object alignment
row-level batch evaluation
read-only lookup usage
```

---

## Expected Impact

```text
Faster cross-block joins for large row counts.
Useful for models with heavy cross-object references.
No full scheduler parallelism required.
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
String allocation is heavy and parallelization may increase memory pressure.
Small datasets may become slower due to Rayon overhead.
Output ordering must remain identical to serial implementation.
Debug counters and missing-count stats need reduction-safe logic.
HashMap must be read-only during parallel access.
```

---

## Dependencies

Can be implemented independently.

Recommended after Issue 1 and Issue 7-style resolver cleanup.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Parallel path is threshold-based.
- Serial fallback remains available.
- Output ordering matches serial implementation.
- Missing/default value behavior matches serial implementation.
- Tests prove serial/parallel parity.
- Benchmarks show improvement on large row counts.

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
simple join path creation
multi-dimension join path creation
missing target keys
target alignment with default values
large row synthetic benchmark
threshold fallback behavior
serial vs parallel parity
```

# ISSUE 6

## Issue Type

Performance Research / Optimization

---

## Title

Evaluate Parallel Lookup-Map Aggregation with Deterministic Reductions

---

## Original Ticket

```text
Ticket 11 - Parallel aggregation for lookup maps
```

---

## Summary

Investigate and implement parallel lookup-map aggregation for large cross-object joins only if deterministic and measurably faster than the current sequential `HashMap` aggregation.

---

## Background / Context

Lookup map creation is in:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/node_alignment/lookup.rs
```

Current aggregation concept:

```rust
for (path, &value) in join_paths.iter().zip(values.iter()) {
    *lookup.entry(path.clone()).or_insert(0.0) += value;
}
```

Supported aggregation modes include:

```text
sum
mean
first
last
```

---

## Problem Statement

For large source row counts, lookup map creation can be expensive.

However, naive parallelization using a shared `HashMap` would require locking and may be slower or nondeterministic.

---

## Proposed Change

Use per-worker local maps and deterministic reduction.

Conceptual approach:

```text
split rows into chunks
each worker builds local HashMap
merge local maps deterministically
```

Aggregation representation:

```rust
enum AggValue {
    Sum(f64),
    Mean { sum: f64, count: usize },
    First { index: usize, value: f64 },
    Last { index: usize, value: f64 },
}
```

Rules:

```text
sum  -> reduce by addition
mean -> reduce sum and count
first -> keep lowest original row index
last -> keep highest original row index
```

---

## Parallelism Opportunity

```text
aggregation/reduction
large cross-object joins
lookup-map construction
```

---

## Expected Impact

```text
Potential speedup for large grouped cross-object references.
Complements Issue 5.
May reduce cost of CrossObjectResolver alignment.
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
Floating-point summation order may change tiny numeric results.
first/last must preserve original row order semantics.
Per-thread maps increase memory usage.
Parallel version may be slower for small/medium inputs.
Must benchmark before enabling by default.
```

---

## Dependencies

Recommended after Issue 5.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Parallel aggregation is deterministic.
- Modes match serial behavior:
  - sum
  - mean
  - first
  - last
- Threshold-based fallback exists.
- Floating-point tolerance is documented.
- Benchmarks justify enabling the parallel path.
- Serial implementation remains available.

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
sum aggregation parity
mean aggregation parity
first aggregation by row index
last aggregation by row index
duplicate join paths
empty input
large synthetic grouped input
deterministic output across repeated runs
serial vs parallel benchmark
```

# Quick Wins vs Larger Refactors

## Larger Refactors

```text
Issue 1 - Core Kahn-style scheduler foundation
Issue 2 - Configurable Rayon-based parallel ready-node execution
```

Why:

```text
They change executor architecture and scheduling.
They require strong output parity tests.
They touch shared state, resolver behavior, and dependency ordering.
```

## Quick / Medium Wins

```text
Issue 3 - Parallel final RecordBatch materialization
Issue 4 - Parallel connected dimension preload
Issue 5 - Parallel join-path creation/alignment
```

Why:

```text
They are more localized.
They are naturally per-block or per-row.
They do not require full scheduler parallelism.
```

## Research / Benchmark First

```text
Issue 6 - Parallel lookup-map aggregation
```

Why:

```text
Correctness is more subtle because aggregation modes must remain deterministic.
Floating-point reduction order may change tiny numeric results.
Must benchmark before enabling by default.
```

---

# Final Notes

The branch’s preload changes create a real opportunity for Rust-side parallelism because metadata can now be moved into `PreloadedMetadata` before execution and Rust execution runs under `py.allow_threads`.

However, the current executor is still serial and mutable-state-centric.

The correct path is:

```text
Issue 1:
    Build safe architecture first.

Issue 2:
    Add controlled parallel ready-node execution.

Issues 3-6:
    Add independent performance optimizations after correctness foundation exists.
```

Do not start by wrapping the whole executor in:

```rust
Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>>
```

Do not parallelize sequential groups initially.

Do not allow worker execution to call Python.

Do not change calculation semantics or output format as part of these issues.



# Additional Omni-Calc Performance Issues: Data Structures, Clone Reduction, and Preloaded Data Usage

## Context

Branch:

```text
Blox-Dev / BLOX-2104-improve-preload-snapshot-py-rust-pass
```

GitHub:

```text
https://github.com/BloxSoftware/Blox-Dev/tree/BLOX-2104-improve-preload-snapshot-py-rust-pass
```

These issues are additional performance/refactor issues after the first 6 parallelization issues.

The first 6 issues mainly cover:

```text
Issue 1 - Kahn-style scheduler foundation
Issue 2 - Parallel ready-node execution with Rayon
Issue 3 - Parallel final RecordBatch materialization
Issue 4 - Parallel connected dimension preload
Issue 5 - Parallel join-path creation/alignment
Issue 6 - Parallel lookup-map aggregation
```

The following issues focus on improving performance by:

```text
better data structures
faster column lookup
less cloning
reusing preloaded data
avoiding Python callbacks in execution hot path
making snapshots/evaluators/resolvers more reference-based
```

Important note:

```text
PyO3 should remain only at the Python boundary / preload stage.

After metadata is preloaded into Rust, Omni-Calc execution should use Rust-owned preloaded data and should not call back into Python from the execution hot path.
```

## Summary

Refactor `CalcObjectState` column storage from linear `Vec<(String, Vec<T>)>` lookup patterns toward a faster indexed column layout.

Currently, `CalcObjectState` stores number, string, and connected dimension columns as vectors of `(column_name, values)` tuples. Column lookup uses linear scans with `.iter().find(...)`, and duplicate checks are also linear. This is simple, but it becomes expensive for wide models with many indicators, properties, connected dimension columns, or repeated formula dependency lookups.

This issue should improve column lookup, insertion, duplicate detection, and merge performance while preserving deterministic output ordering.

modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/resolver.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/formula_eval.rs
```

Current `CalcObjectState` structure:

```rust
pub struct CalcObjectState {
    pub object_key: String,
    pub object_type: CalcObjectType,

    pub dim_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,
    pub row_count: usize,

    pub number_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>,
    pub string_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,
    pub connected_dim_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>,

    pub node_ids: HashSet<i64>,
}
```

Current lookup pattern:

```rust
pub fn get_number_column(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&Vec<f64>> {
    self.number_columns
        .iter()
        .find(|(n, _)| n == name)
        .map(|(_, v)| v)
}
```

Similar lookup exists for:

```rust
get_string_column(...)
get_connected_dim_column(...)
```

---

## Current Behavior

Columns are stored as ordered vectors:

```rust
Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>
Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>
```

This means every lookup scans the full list:

```text
number_columns[0]
number_columns[1]
number_columns[2]
...
```

Column insertion is append-based:

```rust
pub fn add_number_column(&mut self, name: String, values: Vec<f64>) {
    self.number_columns.push((name, values));
}
```

Duplicate detection is usually performed by scanning existing columns before pushing, or later while building the final `RecordBatch`.

---

## Problem Statement

For small models this is fine.

For large/wide models, this becomes expensive because formula execution and merge paths repeatedly need to find columns by name.

Problem areas:

```text
1. Linear lookup for every column access.
2. Linear duplicate checks before merge/insertion.
3. Repeated string comparisons for column names.
4. Wider models become slower as number of indicators/properties grows.
5. Merge phase from NodeOutput becomes slower if every output checks duplicates by scanning Vec.
6. Resolver materialization and formula setup repeatedly walk column vectors.
7. Parallel-ready design needs faster deterministic merges.
```

Example issue:

```rust
state.number_columns
    .iter()
    .find(|(name, _)| name == "ind123")
```

This is `O(number_of_columns)`.

In a wide block with hundreds or thousands of columns, this cost repeats many times.

---

## Why This Matters for Parallelism

Even if Issue 2 introduces Rayon-based parallel node execution, every worker/coordinator merge will still eventually need to access and insert columns.

If column lookup remains linear, then the central merge phase can become a bottleneck.

Target architecture from Issue 1:

```text
Worker calculates NodeOutput
        ↓
Coordinator merges NodeOutput
        ↓
Coordinator updates state/resolver
```

If merge does this for every output column:

```rust
state.number_columns.iter().any(|(name, _)| name == &col.0)
```

then parallel execution can be slowed by a serial `O(n)` merge bottleneck.

So this issue improves both:

```text
current serial execution
future parallel execution
```

---

## Proposed Change

Refactor column storage to preserve stable output order while also allowing fast lookup.

Recommended design:

```rust
struct ColumnStore<T> {
    order: Vec<String>,
    values: HashMap<String, Vec<T>>,
}
```

Or, to avoid duplicating column names:

```rust
struct ColumnStore<T> {
    columns: Vec<(String, Vec<T>)>,
    index: HashMap<String, usize>,
}
```

Recommended first implementation:

```rust
struct ColumnStore<T> {
    columns: Vec<(String, Vec<T>)>,
    index: HashMap<String, usize>,
}

impl<T> ColumnStore<T> {
    fn get(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&Vec<T>> {
        self.index
            .get(name)
            .and_then(|idx| self.columns.get(*idx))
            .map(|(_, values)| values)
    }

    fn contains(&self, name: &str) -> bool {
        self.index.contains_key(name)
    }

    fn insert(&mut self, name: String, values: Vec<T>) {
        if self.index.contains_key(&name) {
            return;
        }

        let idx = self.columns.len();
        self.index.insert(name.clone(), idx);
        self.columns.push((name, values));
    }

    fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &(String, Vec<T>)> {
        self.columns.iter()
    }
}
```

Then update `CalcObjectState` conceptually to:

```rust
pub struct CalcObjectState {
    pub object_key: String,
    pub object_type: CalcObjectType,

    pub dim_columns: ColumnStore<String>,
    pub row_count: usize,

    pub number_columns: ColumnStore<f64>,
    pub string_columns: ColumnStore<String>,
    pub connected_dim_columns: ColumnStore<String>,

    pub node_ids: HashSet<i64>,
}
```

If changing `dim_columns` is too invasive initially, start with:

```text
number_columns
string_columns
connected_dim_columns
```

and keep `dim_columns` unchanged for compatibility.

---

## Recommended Incremental Approach

### Phase 1: Add `ColumnStore<T>`

Add a generic helper type:

```rust
ColumnStore<T>
```

with:

```text
insert
get
contains
iter
len
is_empty
```

Preserve stable insertion order.

---

### Phase 2: Convert Number/String/Connected Columns

Start with:

```text
number_columns
string_columns
connected_dim_columns
```

because these are loaded dynamically and are most important for calculation/merge.

---

### Phase 3: Keep Compatibility Helpers

Keep helper methods on `CalcObjectState`:

```rust
get_number_column(...)
get_string_column(...)
get_connected_dim_column(...)
add_number_column(...)
add_string_column(...)
add_connected_dim_column(...)
```

but make them use `ColumnStore` internally.

---

### Phase 4: Update RecordBatch Builder

Update:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/context.rs
```

`build_record_batch(state)` should iterate in stable column order:

```rust
for (col_name, values) in state.number_columns.iter() {
    ...
}
```

---

### Phase 5: Update Merge Logic From Issue 1

When `NodeOutput` is merged:

```rust
if !state.number_columns.contains(&col_name) {
    state.number_columns.insert(col_name, values);
}
```

This avoids `O(n)` scans during merge.

---

## Expected Impact

Expected improvements:

```text
1. Faster column lookup for formula evaluation.
2. Faster duplicate detection during merge.
3. Faster state mutation during node output merge.
4. Faster resolver and RecordBatch preparation.
5. Better scalability for wide models.
6. Lower coordinator bottleneck in future parallel scheduler.
```

Practical expected benefit:

```text
Small models: low impact
Wide models: medium to high impact
Parallel-ready executor: important to prevent merge bottleneck
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
1. Must preserve output column order.
2. Must not change RecordBatch schema ordering unexpectedly.
3. Duplicate column behavior must remain compatible.
4. Existing code expects Vec<(String, Vec<T>)>; refactor may touch many call sites.
5. Generic ColumnStore must not overcomplicate borrow/lifetime handling.
6. Tests must prove serial output parity.
```

---

## Dependencies

Recommended after or alongside:

```text
Issue 1 - Core Kahn-style scheduler foundation
```

This issue can be implemented independently, but it becomes more valuable once `NodeOutput` merge is added.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

```text
1. `CalcObjectState` has indexed lookup for dynamic columns.
2. Number column lookup is no longer linear.
3. String column lookup is no longer linear.
4. Connected dimension column lookup is no longer linear.
5. Insertion order is preserved.
6. Duplicate column insertion is prevented in O(1) average time.
7. `build_record_batch` output schema order remains deterministic.
8. Existing tests pass.
9. New tests cover lookup, insertion, duplicate insert, and iteration order.
10. Serial executor output matches current behavior.
```

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
ColumnStore insert/get
ColumnStore duplicate insert
ColumnStore stable order
CalcObjectState get_number_column
CalcObjectState get_string_column
CalcObjectState get_connected_dim_column
RecordBatch schema order
merge NodeOutput duplicate prevention
large synthetic column lookup benchmark
```

## Title

Reduce Cloning by Reusing Preloaded Data and Shared Column References in Omni-Calc Execution

---

## Summary

Reduce unnecessary cloning of large vectors, preloaded metadata, formula input columns, resolver data, and Arrow output data by introducing shared references or `Arc`-backed column storage where safe.

The branch already moves metadata into Rust-side `PreloadedMetadata`, but some execution paths still clone large vectors or rebuild structures repeatedly. This issue should make better use of preloaded Rust-owned data and reduce clone-heavy execution paths.

Goal:

```text
Use preloaded data once.
Share references where possible.
Avoid Python callbacks after preload.
Avoid cloning large columns unless ownership is truly required.
```

---

## Relevant Code Areas

Primary files:

```text
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/context.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/preload.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/dim_loader.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/formula_eval.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/get_source_data/resolver.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/calculation.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/engine/exec/steps/input_handler/mod.rs
modelAPI/omni-calc/src/python.rs
```

Important current patterns:

### `ExecutionContext::new`

Current behavior clones plan maps into resolver:

```rust
let resolver = CrossObjectResolver::new(
    plan.request.node_maps.clone(),
    plan.request.variable_filters.clone(),
);
```

### `build_record_batch`

Current behavior clones column vectors into Arrow arrays:

```rust
StringArray::from(values.clone())
Float64Array::from(values.clone())
```

### `build_execution_result`

Current behavior clones warnings into result:

```rust
for warning in &ctx.warnings {
    result.add_warning(warning.clone());
}
```

### `FormulaEvaluator`

Current evaluator owns columns:

```rust
columns: HashMap<String, Vec<f64>>
dim_string_columns: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>
time_values: Vec<String>
```

and setup paths clone dimension/time columns.

### `PreloadedMetadata`

Current branch has Rust-owned preloaded data:

```rust
pub struct PreloadedMetadata {
    pub dimension_items: HashMap<i64, Vec<DimensionItem>>,
    pub property_maps: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), HashMap<i64, String>>,
}
```

---

## Current Behavior

The branch already preloads metadata from Python before execution:

```rust
let preloaded =
    crate::engine::exec::preload::preload_metadata(py, metadata_cache.as_ref(), &plan.inner)
        .map_err(pyo3::exceptions::PyRuntimeError::new_err)?;

engine.set_preloaded_metadata(preloaded);

let result = py
    .allow_threads(|| runtime::execute(&mut engine, plan.inner.clone()))
    .map_err(|e| pyo3::exceptions::PyRuntimeError::new_err(e.to_string()))?;
```

This is good because Rust execution runs after preload and outside the GIL.

However, within Rust execution, there are still clone-heavy areas:

```text
1. Plan maps cloned into resolver.
2. Column vectors cloned into Arrow arrays.
3. Formula evaluator owns and clones column vectors.
4. Dimension/time string columns are cloned into evaluator context.
5. Property maps may be rebuilt or copied instead of shared.
6. Resolver may repeatedly rebuild RecordBatches from cloned state.
```

---

## Problem Statement

Large Omni-Calc models can have:

```text
many blocks
many rows per block
many indicators
many property columns
many connected dimension columns
many cross-object joins
large preloaded metadata maps
```

In this case, cloning large `Vec<f64>` and `Vec<String>` values can become expensive.

Main costs:

```text
CPU cost of copying large vectors
memory allocation pressure
higher peak memory usage
slower resolver updates
slower final materialization
slower formula evaluator setup
less benefit from future parallelism due to memory bandwidth pressure
```

Even if Rayon parallelism is added, clone-heavy execution may become memory-bound.

---

## Preloaded Data Requirement

This issue must reinforce the rule:

```text
After preload, Rust execution hot path should use `PreloadedMetadata` and should not call Python/PyO3.
```

Allowed PyO3 usage:

```text
Python boundary
CalcPlan extraction
metadata preload before execution
returning result to Python
```

Not allowed in execution hot path:

```text
metadata_cache.call_method1(...)
Python<'_>
PyObject-based property loading
lazy Python callback from worker/node execution
```

If metadata is missing from preload, execution should fail early in preloaded-only mode.

---

## Proposed Change

### 1. Introduce Shared Column Types

Introduce shared immutable column aliases:

```rust
type NumberColumn = Arc<[f64]>;
type StringColumn = Arc<[String]>;
```

or:

```rust
type NumberColumn = Arc<Vec<f64>>;
type StringColumn = Arc<Vec<String>>;
```

Recommended long-term:

```rust
Arc<[T]>
```

because it expresses immutable shared slices.

Example:

```rust
struct SharedColumnStore<T> {
    columns: Vec<(String, Arc<[T]>)>,
    index: HashMap<String, usize>,
}
```

This combines Issue 7 and Issue 8 well:

```text
Issue 7 = faster lookup/indexing
Issue 8 = avoid cloning values
```

---

### 2. Use Borrowed or Shared Columns in `ExecutionSnapshot`

Future `ExecutionSnapshot` from Issue 1 should avoid cloning columns.

Instead of:

```rust
number_columns: Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>
```

prefer:

```rust
number_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<f64>>
```

or:

```rust
number_columns: Vec<(String, Arc<[f64]>)>
```

Snapshot should be cheap to clone:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct ExecutionSnapshot {
    block_key: String,
    number_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<f64>>,
    string_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<String>>,
    connected_dim_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<String>>,
    preloaded_metadata: Arc<PreloadedMetadata>,
}
```

---

### 3. Avoid Cloning Preloaded Metadata

`PreloadedMetadata` should be stored and passed as:

```rust
Arc<PreloadedMetadata>
```

or referenced immutably for the full execution lifetime.

Avoid copying maps like:

```rust
HashMap<i64, Vec<DimensionItem>>
HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), HashMap<i64, String>>
```

Use shared references to read property maps.

---

### 4. Convert Property Caches to Read-Only Shared Snapshots

Current `ExecutionContext` has mutable caches:

```rust
pub string_property_map_cache: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), StringPropertyMap>,
pub numeric_property_map_cache: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), (PropertyMap, Vec<String>)>,
```

For future parallelism, prefer a prebuilt immutable cache:

```rust
struct PropertyCacheSnapshot {
    string_maps: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), Arc<StringPropertyMap>>,
    numeric_maps: HashMap<(i64, i64, i64), Arc<(PropertyMap, Vec<String>)>>,
}
```

Then property node execution reads:

```rust
property_cache.string_maps.get(&key)
property_cache.numeric_maps.get(&key)
```

without rebuilding or locking.

---

### 5. Reduce FormulaEvaluator Column Clones

Current evaluator owns:

```rust
HashMap<String, Vec<f64>>
HashMap<String, Vec<String>>
```

This requires moving/cloning vectors into the evaluator.

Consider an evaluator context based on borrowed/shared references:

```rust
struct EvalContext<'a> {
    columns: HashMap<String, &'a [f64]>,
    dim_string_columns: HashMap<String, &'a [String]>,
}
```

or shared refs:

```rust
struct EvalContext {
    columns: HashMap<String, Arc<[f64]>>,
    dim_string_columns: HashMap<String, Arc<[String]>>,
}
```

Recommended practical approach:

```text
Use Arc-backed columns first.
Avoid lifetime-heavy borrowed evaluator until architecture is stable.
```

This makes evaluator snapshots `Send + Sync` friendly for future Rayon work.

---

### 6. Reduce Resolver Rebuild Clones

`ctx.update_resolver(&block_key)` currently rebuilds a `RecordBatch` from current state.

This internally calls:

```rust
build_record_batch(state)
```

which clones all column vectors into Arrow arrays.

From Issue 1, resolver updates should be moved to dependency-safe boundaries.

For this issue, also evaluate whether resolver can store a lighter read-only block snapshot instead of repeatedly storing cloned Arrow data.

Possible intermediate design:

```rust
struct BlockSnapshot {
    dim_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<String>>,
    connected_dim_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<String>>,
    string_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<String>>,
    number_columns: Arc<ColumnStore<f64>>,
}
```

Then only materialize Arrow when required.

---

### 7. Avoid Re-Cloning Plan Maps into Resolver

Current initialization clones:

```rust
plan.request.node_maps.clone()
plan.request.variable_filters.clone()
```

If these are immutable during execution, use references or `Arc`:

```rust
CrossObjectResolver::new(
    Arc::new(plan.request.node_maps.clone()),
    Arc::new(plan.request.variable_filters.clone()),
)
```

Better long-term:

```rust
CrossObjectResolver<'a> {
    node_maps: &'a [PlannedNodeMap],
    variable_filters: &'a HashMap<String, VariableFilter>,
}
```

or:

```rust
CrossObjectResolver {
    node_maps: Arc<[PlannedNodeMap]>,
    variable_filters: Arc<HashMap<String, VariableFilter>>,
}
```

Choice depends on lifetime complexity.

For parallel-ready snapshots, `Arc` may be easier.

---

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Identify and Benchmark Clone Hotspots

Add tracing/benchmarks around:

```text
ExecutionContext::new
build_record_batch
ctx.update_resolver
build_execution_result
formula evaluator setup
property map loading
cross-object resolver path
```

Track:

```text
number of rows
number of columns
number of clones/materializations
elapsed time
peak memory if available
```

---

### Phase 2: Introduce Shared Column Types

Add:

```rust
type SharedNumberColumn = Arc<[f64]>;
type SharedStringColumn = Arc<[String]>;
```

Start with internal conversion in new structures.

---

### Phase 3: Combine With Issue 7 ColumnStore

Use:

```rust
ColumnStore<T>
```

or:

```rust
SharedColumnStore<T>
```

to get both:

```text
fast lookup
less cloning
stable ordering
```

---

### Phase 4: Convert Property Cache to Immutable Snapshot

Build property cache once from `PreloadedMetadata`.

Then read it immutably during execution.

No Python callback.

No mutable cache lock.

No repeated map rebuild.

---

### Phase 5: Make Evaluator Use Shared Columns

Move evaluator toward:

```rust
HashMap<String, Arc<[f64]>>
```

instead of:

```rust
HashMap<String, Vec<f64>>
```

Where formula functions require owned `Vec<f64>` output, only allocate for actual computed results, not for input columns.

---

### Phase 6: Reduce Resolver Materialization

Avoid rebuilding full `RecordBatch` after every node.

Prefer:

```text
shared block snapshot for resolver reads
Arrow RecordBatch only when needed
```

This should align with Issue 1 resolver boundary work.

---

## Expected Impact

Expected performance improvements:

```text
1. Lower memory usage.
2. Lower CPU spent copying vectors.
3. Faster formula setup.
4. Faster resolver updates.
5. Faster final materialization.
6. Better scalability for large/wide models.
7. Better performance from future Rayon parallelism because memory bandwidth is less saturated.
```

Practical expectation:

```text
Small models: small improvement
Large row-count models: medium/high improvement
Wide models: high improvement
Cross-object-heavy models: high improvement when combined with resolver/join changes
```

---

## Risks / Edge Cases

```text
1. `Arc<[T]>` makes columns immutable; mutation flow must append new columns instead of mutating existing ones.
2. Some formula functions may expect owned `Vec<f64>` and need careful adaptation.
3. Borrowed lifetimes may complicate evaluator design; prefer Arc first.
4. Arrow arrays may still need conversion/copy depending on input type.
5. Changing ownership model can create compile-time lifetime complexity.
6. Must preserve exact calculation semantics.
7. Must preserve output ordering.
8. Must preserve warning behavior.
9. Must ensure all shared data is Send + Sync before Rayon execution.
```

---

## Dependencies

Recommended dependencies:

```text
Issue 1 - Core Kahn-style scheduler foundation
Issue 7 - ColumnStore / faster column lookup
```

This issue can start independently with clone hotspot benchmarks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

```text
1. Major clone-heavy paths are identified and documented.
2. Preloaded metadata is reused by reference or Arc, not cloned repeatedly.
3. Property maps are built from PreloadedMetadata, not Python callbacks.
4. Worker-ready execution paths do not require PyO3.
5. Formula evaluator input columns can be shared or borrowed where safe.
6. Resolver update/materialization avoids unnecessary full data cloning where possible.
7. RecordBatch materialization remains correct.
8. Output schema and ordering remain unchanged.
9. Serial executor output matches current behavior.
10. Memory usage and runtime are benchmarked before/after.
```

---

## Testing Notes

Add tests for:

```text
shared column lookup
shared column merge
formula evaluation using shared columns
property cache built from PreloadedMetadata
missing preloaded metadata failure
no Python callback in execution hot path
RecordBatch output parity
resolver output parity
serial vs optimized output parity
large column memory benchmark
```

---

Full Arrow zero-copy rewrite

# Coverage Check: Do Issues 1-9 Cover Preloaded Data and Python Callback Removal?

## Short Answer

Yes, the full issue set from Issue 1 to Issue 9 covers this.

The intended rule is:

```text
Use PyO3 only at the Python boundary and preload stage.
Do not call Python/PyO3 from the Rust execution hot path after preload.
Use PreloadedMetadata and immutable Rust-owned snapshots during execution.
```

---

## Where It Is Covered

### Issue 1

Covers:

```text
Remove/isolate Python callback paths from Rust hot path
Preloaded-only worker-ready execution
No Python callbacks during node execution
Fail early if required preloaded metadata is missing
```

### Issue 2

Covers:

```text
Parallel workers must not call Python
Parallel workers must use immutable snapshots
Parallel property/input/calculation execution must use preloaded Rust data
```

### Issue 7

Covers:

```text
Better state structure for faster access to already-loaded data
Faster merge and lookup without repeated scans
Improves use of Rust-owned execution state
```

### Issue 8

Covers:

```text
Reuse preloaded data by reference or Arc
Avoid cloning preloaded maps and large column vectors
Use shared column references in snapshots/evaluators/resolver
Avoid Python fallback in optimized execution paths
```

### Issue 9

Covers separately:

```text
Avoid repeated String allocation/cloning for join keys
Improve cross-object join key representation
Make better use of IDs / encoded keys instead of repeated string paths
```

---

## Final Recommended Rule To Add Across Issues

Add this sentence to all implementation tickets touching execution:

```text
All execution-hot-path logic must use Rust-owned preloaded data and must not perform PyO3/Python metadata callbacks. PyO3 is allowed only at the external Python binding boundary and during the explicit preload phase before Rust execution starts.
```

---

# Final Notes

The first 6 issues cover the parallelization strategy.

Issue 7 and Issue 8 add the missing performance foundation around:

```text
better data structures
faster column lookup
less cloning
better reuse of preloaded data
no Python callbacks in execution
lower memory pressure
```

Together, Issues 1-9 give a stronger optimization plan:

```text
Issues 1-6:
    safe parallelism

Issue 7:
    faster state and column lookup

Issue 8:
    less cloning and better shared data reuse

Issue 9:
    faster join keys and less string allocation
```


# Epic: Performance, Preloading, Data Structure, and Parallel Execution Improvements for Rust `omni-calc`

## Summary

This epic covers additional performance and architecture improvements for the Rust `omni-calc` executor after the initial executor refactor work.

The goal is to improve:

- Better use of `PreloadedMetadata`
- Safer future Rayon-based parallel execution
- Reduced Python callback dependency
- Faster snapshot creation
- Lower memory cloning overhead
- Faster resolver refresh behavior
- Better data structures for hot execution paths
- Improved dependency validation before parallel execution
- Benchmarking and profiling coverage

These issues should be treated as follow-up tickets after the initial Issues 1–9 executor refactor work.

The main direction is:

```text
Python = plan creation and metadata preparation
Rust = execution, dependency tracking, snapshots, scheduling, and merge
Workers = read immutable snapshots only
Merge phase = only place where shared state is mutated
```

Python callbacks should not be introduced inside worker-style execution paths.

## Summary

Improve `PreloadedMetadata` so Rust execution workers can read all required metadata from Rust-owned immutable structures without needing Python callbacks, lazy loading, or shared mutable metadata caches during calculation.

## Problem

For future Rayon-based parallel execution, worker threads should not depend on:

- Python callbacks
- GIL-bound metadata access
- Shared mutable metadata caches
- Runtime lazy metadata resolution
- Blocking metadata fetches during node execution

If metadata is incomplete during execution, parallel execution can become blocked, non-deterministic, or slower than serial execution.

## Proposed Direction

Refactor and expand `PreloadedMetadata` to include all metadata required by:

- Input step execution
- Calculation step execution
- Property step execution
- Cross-object resolution
- Variable filters
- Dimension lookups
- Property map lookups
- Formula dependency handling
- Source block / connected block resolution

The metadata should be loaded before execution starts and shared through immutable structures.

Example direction:

```rust
struct PreloadedMetadata {
    blocks: Arc<HashMap<BlockId, BlockMetadata>>,
    indicators: Arc<HashMap<IndicatorId, IndicatorMetadata>>,
    dimensions: Arc<HashMap<DimensionId, DimensionMetadata>>,
    properties: Arc<HashMap<PropertyId, PropertyMetadata>>,
    variable_filters: Arc<HashMap<FilterId, VariableFilterMetadata>>,
    property_maps: Arc<PropertyMapStore>,
}
```

Execution workers should receive metadata through `ExecutionSnapshot`.

```rust
struct ExecutionSnapshot {
    block_id: BlockId,
    preloaded_metadata: Arc<PreloadedMetadata>,
    resolver_snapshot: Arc<CrossObjectResolverSnapshot>,
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Required execution metadata is available before node execution starts.
- Worker-style execution paths do not call back into Python.
- Metadata is stored in immutable, shareable Rust structures such as `Arc`.
- Existing metadata caches are removed from hot paths where possible.
- Missing metadata produces a clear validation error before execution starts.
- Tests verify that execution works using only preloaded metadata.
- No new Python callback is introduced inside the Rust node execution path.

# Issue 11: Introduce Snapshot-Friendly Column Storage Using Shared `Arc` Data

## Summary

Refactor execution column storage so snapshots can cheaply share existing block data without repeatedly cloning full vectors of dimension, string, number, and connected dimension columns.

## Problem

The future execution model depends on building read-only snapshots for each node.

If each snapshot deep-clones all column data, then parallel execution may become memory-heavy and slower than the current serial execution.

Current column structures such as:

```rust
Vec<(String, Vec<f64>)>
Vec<(String, Vec<String>)>
```

can cause unnecessary cloning when used across multiple snapshots.

## Proposed Direction

Introduce shared column storage using immutable `Arc`-backed data.

Example concept:

```rust
struct ColumnStore {
    dim_columns: HashMap<ColumnId, Arc<Vec<String>>>,
    number_columns: HashMap<ColumnId, Arc<Vec<f64>>>,
    string_columns: HashMap<ColumnId, Arc<Vec<String>>>,
    connected_dim_columns: HashMap<ColumnId, Arc<Vec<String>>>,
}
```

Snapshots should reference existing column data instead of cloning it:

```rust
struct ExecutionSnapshot {
    block_id: BlockId,
    columns: Arc<ColumnStore>,
}
```

Newly calculated outputs should still be owned by `NodeOutput` until they are merged.

```rust
struct NodeOutput {
    block_id: BlockId,
    number_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<f64>)>,
    string_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<String>)>,
    connected_dim_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<String>)>,
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Execution snapshots do not deep-clone large column vectors unnecessarily.
- Existing calculated columns are shared using immutable `Arc` data.
- Newly calculated node outputs remain separately owned until merge.
- Snapshot creation becomes cheaper for large execution plans.
- Existing calculation behavior remains unchanged.
- Tests cover snapshot creation with shared column data.
- Benchmarks or profiling verify reduced snapshot creation overhead.

# Issue 12: Add Rayon-Based Ready-Layer Parallel Execution Behind a Feature Flag

## Summary

Add an experimental Rayon-based execution path that parallelizes only safe ready nodes after the single-threaded Kahn-style scheduler has been introduced and validated.

## Problem

The executor currently runs serially.

Even after graph-driven scheduling is introduced, execution will remain single-threaded unless ready nodes are executed concurrently.

However, parallelization should not be added blindly to all nodes because some nodes may depend on:

- Sequential execution semantics
- Resolver update timing
- Cross-object references
- Python-backed metadata
- Shared mutable state
- Overlapping output columns

## Proposed Direction

Add a feature-gated or config-gated parallel execution mode.

Example:

```rust
let outputs: Vec<NodeOutput> = ready_nodes
    .into_par_iter()
    .map(|node| {
        let snapshot = build_snapshot_readonly(&ctx, &node);
        execute_node(snapshot, node)
    })
    .collect();

merge_node_outputs(&mut ctx, outputs);
```

Only nodes marked as parallel-safe should be included.

```rust
struct ExecNode {
    id: NodeId,
    block_id: BlockId,
    deps: Vec<NodeId>,
    outputs: Vec<ColumnId>,
    parallel_safe: bool,
}
```

## Safe Initial Candidates

Parallelization can initially be allowed for:

- Independent input indicator nodes
- Calculation nodes whose dependencies are complete
- Property nodes that only read preloaded metadata
- Nodes that produce distinct output columns
- Nodes that do not require immediate resolver mutation

## Do Not Parallelize Initially

Do not parallelize these node types initially:

- Sequential groups
- Nodes requiring unresolved cross-object references
- Nodes requiring Python callbacks
- Nodes depending on immediate mutable resolver updates
- Nodes writing to overlapping output columns
- Nodes with unclear dependency boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria

- Parallel execution is behind a feature flag or config option.
- Default execution remains serial unless parallel mode is explicitly enabled.
- Rayon is used only for ready nodes marked as parallel-safe.
- Sequential groups continue to execute atomically.
- Output ordering remains deterministic where required.
- Serial and parallel execution outputs are tested for equality.
- Tests verify unsafe nodes are excluded from Rayon execution.
- Benchmarks show speedup on eligible workloads.

# Issue 13: Replace Hot-Path String Lookups with Interned IDs

## Summary

Reduce hot-path overhead by replacing repeated string-based block, node, indicator, and column lookups with compact internal IDs.

## Problem

The executor currently relies heavily on string identifiers such as:

```text
block39951
ind259068
block39951___ind259068
```

Repeated string parsing, cloning, hashing, and comparison can become expensive during:

- Graph construction
- Dependency checks
- Resolver lookups
- Snapshot creation
- Node execution
- Output merge
- Warning generation

## Proposed Direction

Introduce interned IDs for hot-path execution.

Example:

```rust
struct BlockId(usize);
struct NodeId(usize);
struct ColumnId(usize);
struct IndicatorId(usize);
struct PropertyId(usize);
```

Maintain a registry that maps external string names to internal IDs.

```rust
struct IdRegistry {
    block_ids: HashMap<String, BlockId>,
    node_ids: HashMap<String, NodeId>,
    column_ids: HashMap<String, ColumnId>,
    indicator_ids: HashMap<String, IndicatorId>,

    block_names: Vec<String>,
    node_names: Vec<String>,
    column_names: Vec<String>,
    indicator_names: Vec<String>,
}
```

Use compact IDs internally while preserving original string names for:

- API compatibility
- Output format
- Debug logs
- Error messages
- Warnings

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hot-path graph and dependency logic uses internal IDs instead of raw strings.
- Public output format remains unchanged.
- String-to-ID conversion happens once during plan preparation.
- Existing warnings and error messages still include readable names.
- Tests verify ID mapping correctness.
- Tests verify original external names are preserved in final output.
- Benchmarks show reduced overhead in graph build and execution paths.

# Issue 14: Add Dependency-Aware Resolver Snapshot Refresh

## Summary

Optimize `CrossObjectResolver` updates by refreshing resolver snapshots only when downstream dependencies require updated source block data.

## Problem

Currently, resolver updates may rebuild a full `RecordBatch` after individual node execution.

This can cause repeated expensive work.

Current behavior can look like:

```text
node 1 -> rebuild source block RecordBatch
node 2 -> rebuild source block RecordBatch
node 3 -> rebuild source block RecordBatch
```

For large blocks, repeated Arrow array construction and cloning can be costly.

## Proposed Direction

Track which downstream nodes require resolver-visible data from each source block.

Only refresh resolver state when:

- A source block has completed the required columns for downstream references
- A dependency boundary is reached
- A ready batch/layer has finished
- A downstream node is about to read cross-object data
- Resolver-visible data has actually changed

Example concept:

```rust
struct ResolverRefreshPlan {
    required_by_block: HashMap<BlockId, Vec<CrossObjectDependency>>,
    dirty_blocks: HashSet<BlockId>,
}
```

Resolver updates should happen in a controlled merge phase, not inside each node execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Resolver refresh is not blindly triggered after every node output.
- Resolver update decisions are dependency-aware.
- Cross-object references still resolve correctly.
- Serial behavior remains unchanged.
- Resolver is updated before downstream nodes that need source data are released.
- Tests cover same-block dependencies.
- Tests cover cross-block dependencies.
- Tests cover resolver refresh timing.
- Tests cover missing source data errors.
- Performance improves for plans with multiple outputs from the same source block.

# Issue 15: Batch `NodeOutput` Merge Operations

## Summary

Improve merge performance by batching multiple `NodeOutput` values before mutating `ExecutionContext`.

## Problem

In a future parallel ready-layer execution model, multiple nodes may finish together and produce multiple `NodeOutput` values.

Merging each output one by one can cause repeated:

- Block state lookups
- Column existence checks
- Resolver refresh checks
- Warning extensions
- Stats updates
- Mutable state operations

## Proposed Direction

Introduce a batched merge function.

Example:

```rust
fn merge_node_outputs(ctx: &mut ExecutionContext, outputs: Vec<NodeOutput>) {
    // group outputs by block_id
    // append columns in batch
    // collect warnings
    // update nodes_calculated
    // refresh resolver once per affected block when required
}
```

Group outputs by:

- `block_id`
- affected output columns
- resolver update requirement
- warning collection
- calculated node count

Example internal grouping:

```rust
struct BlockOutputBatch {
    block_id: BlockId,
    number_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<f64>)>,
    string_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<String>)>,
    connected_dim_columns: Vec<(ColumnId, Vec<String>)>,
    should_update_resolver: bool,
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple `NodeOutput` values can be merged in one controlled mutation phase.
- Outputs are grouped by block before merge.
- Warnings and stats are accumulated once per batch.
- Resolver refresh happens at most once per affected block per merge batch.
- Existing serial behavior remains unchanged.
- Tests cover multiple outputs for the same block.
- Tests cover multiple outputs for different blocks.
- Tests cover duplicate column prevention.
- Tests cover resolver update behavior during batch merge.

# Issue 16: Add Execution Profiling and Benchmarks for Scheduler, Snapshot, Merge, and Resolver

## Summary

Add benchmark and profiling coverage for the new execution architecture to measure real performance gains and identify bottlenecks.

## Problem

Executor refactors around snapshots, preloading, graph scheduling, resolver updates, Arrow `RecordBatch` construction, and Rayon parallelism need measurable validation.

Without benchmarks, it is difficult to know whether changes actually improve performance or only improve architecture.

## Proposed Direction

Add benchmarks for:

- Graph construction
- Formula dependency extraction
- Metadata preload
- Snapshot creation
- Node execution
- `NodeOutput` merge
- Batched merge
- Resolver update
- Arrow `RecordBatch` construction
- Serial Kahn scheduler
- Parallel ready-layer execution
- Large block execution
- Cross-object dependency-heavy execution
- Property-heavy execution
- Sequential group execution

Suggested benchmark categories:

```text
Small plan:
  low number of blocks and indicators

Medium plan:
  multiple blocks, formulas, properties, and filters

Large plan:
  large column vectors and many calculation nodes

Cross-object plan:
  many source block references

Property-heavy plan:
  many metadata/property lookups
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmark cases exist for small, medium, and large plans.
- Resolver rebuild cost is measured separately.
- Snapshot creation cost is measured separately.
- Serial vs parallel execution can be compared.
- Metadata preload cost is measured separately.
- Arrow `RecordBatch` construction cost is measured separately.
- Benchmarks can be run locally by developers.
- Results help identify remaining hot paths.
- Documentation explains how to run the benchmarks.

# Issue 17: Add Pre-Execution Validation for Parallel-Safety

## Summary

Add a validation pass that checks whether each execution node is safe for future parallel execution.

## Problem

Not every node should be parallelized.

Some nodes may depend on:

- Sequential semantics
- Mutable resolver state
- Cross-object data availability
- Python-backed metadata access
- Overlapping output columns
- Missing dependency information
- Shared mutable caches

Without validation, parallel execution may produce incorrect or non-deterministic results.

## Proposed Direction

Add a pre-execution validation phase that marks each node as either parallel-safe or not parallel-safe.

Example:

```rust
struct ParallelSafety {
    parallel_safe: bool,
    reasons: Vec<ParallelSafetyReason>,
}
```

Example reasons:

```rust
enum ParallelSafetyReason {
    SequentialGroup,
    RequiresPythonCallback,
    RequiresMutableResolverDuringExecution,
    HasUnresolvedCrossObjectDependency,
    WritesOverlappingOutputColumn,
    MissingPreloadedMetadata,
    UnknownDependencyBoundary,
}
```

Each `ExecNode` should include the validation result:

```rust
struct ExecNode {
    id: NodeId,
    block_id: BlockId,
    deps: Vec<NodeId>,
    outputs: Vec<ColumnId>,
    parallel_safety: ParallelSafety,
}
```

## Validation Should Check

- Whether all metadata is preloaded
- Whether dependencies are explicit
- Whether outputs are distinct
- Whether the node belongs to a sequential group
- Whether it requires resolver updates before downstream execution
- Whether it depends on Python callbacks
- Whether it mutates shared state
- Whether output columns overlap with another ready node

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every node has a clear parallel-safety classification.
- Unsafe nodes are excluded from Rayon execution.
- Validation errors are clear and actionable.
- Sequential nodes are always marked unsafe initially.
- Missing metadata marks the node as unsafe or fails before execution.
- Tests cover safe node classification.
- Tests cover unsafe node classification.
- Tests cover overlapping output columns.
- Tests cover Python callback dependency detection.
- Tests cover sequential group safety handling.

# Issue 18: Optimize Formula Dependency Parsing and Graph Build

## Summary

Improve formula dependency extraction so the Rust execution graph can be built accurately and efficiently without repeatedly parsing formulas during scheduling or execution.

## Problem

A future Rust-side Kahn scheduler requires accurate dependency tracking between nodes.

If formula references are parsed repeatedly during execution, graph construction and scheduling can become slower and more error-prone.

Formula dependency parsing is especially important for references like:

```text
ind259068
block39951___ind259068
property references
variable filter references
connected block references
```

## Proposed Direction

Extract formula dependencies once during graph construction.

Store parsed dependency information directly in each `ExecNode`.

Example:

```rust
struct ExecNode {
    id: NodeId,
    block_id: BlockId,
    deps: Vec<NodeId>,
    output_columns: Vec<ColumnId>,
    same_block_deps: Vec<ColumnId>,
    cross_object_deps: Vec<CrossObjectDependency>,
    property_deps: Vec<PropertyId>,
    parallel_safe: bool,
}
```

Example cross-object dependency:

```rust
struct CrossObjectDependency {
    source_block_id: BlockId,
    source_column_id: ColumnId,
    required_before_node: NodeId,
}
```

The scheduler should use this dependency information directly instead of parsing formula strings repeatedly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Formula dependencies are parsed once during graph construction.
- Same-block dependencies are represented explicitly.
- Cross-object dependencies are represented explicitly.
- Property dependencies are represented explicitly.
- Scheduler does not parse formula strings repeatedly.
- Dependency extraction handles same-block indicator references.
- Dependency extraction handles cross-block indicator references.
- Dependency extraction handles property references.
- Dependency extraction handles sequential group dependencies.
- Tests cover dependency parsing.
- Tests cover graph ordering.
- Tests cover missing dependency detection.
- Tests cover invalid formula reference errors.

# Overall Notes

These issues should not introduce Python callbacks inside Rust worker execution.

The preferred architecture is:

```text
Before execution:
  Python builds CalcPlan
  Rust validates plan
  Rust preloads metadata
  Rust builds execution graph
  Rust validates parallel-safety

During execution:
  Coordinator owns ExecutionContext
  Coordinator owns ready queue and graph indegrees
  Workers receive immutable ExecutionSnapshot
  Workers execute node logic
  Workers return NodeOutput
  Merge phase mutates ExecutionContext

After merge:
  Resolver refresh happens only when required
  Dependent nodes are released
  Final output format remains unchanged
```

Avoid this pattern:

```rust
Arc<Mutex<ExecutionContext>>
```

for the full node execution lifecycle.

Prefer this pattern:

```text
Build immutable snapshot
        ↓
Execute node without mutating global state
        ↓
Return NodeOutput
        ↓
Batch merge outputs in controlled mutation phase
        ↓
Refresh resolver only when needed
        ↓
Release dependent nodes
```

This gives the executor a safe path toward real Rayon-based parallel execution without breaking current calculation semantics.
